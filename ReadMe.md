# node-dora-cli

A CLI tool for the [node-dora](https://github.com/edm00se/node-dora) package.

## Installation

- `npm install --global dora-cli`

You can also save it as a project dependency, with `--save` or `--save-dev`.

## Usage

Assuming you have an On Disk Project at a relative path of "My Amazing ODP", you can use the cli for dora via `dora 'My Amazing ODP'`.
